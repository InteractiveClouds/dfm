            dreamface update [dfx] [dfc]

            dreamface restart [ ( [dev] [dep] ) | dfx ] [dfc]

    DESCRIPTION
            Updates and/or restarts dreamface compiler, deployment and development servers.
            dfx is common name for both dev and dep servers.
            dfc is compiler.
            dev and dep can not be updated separately, only together.
            dfc will be restarted if dev is restarted

            It looks for config file at either:
                
                /usr/local/etc/dfm.config.json
                ~/.dfm/dfm.config.json
                /etc/dfm.config.json

            See example of the config at dfm.config.example.json
